\title{Compile the values from a set of SparrowResult Objects}
\usage{
ct.gatherSparrow(resultList)
}
\arguments{
\item{resultList}{A named list of `SparrowResult` objects}
}
\value{
A (test-level) list of (output-level) lists of (statistic-level) dataframes, such that category statistics can be easily 
compared to one another.
}
\description{
This function takes in a named list of `SparrowResult` objects and breaks them into in0register data.frames for easy comprisons. 
Specifically, the function assembles the values in each of the `@result` slots for each of the provided contrasts into standalone 
`data.frame`s with the rows named for the pathways, and returns these objects as a list-of-lists for each result type.

Note that results are compiled as-is, so users need to orient the screen results themselves in whatever manner they deem appropriate.

data('resultsDF')
sparrowres <- ct.seas(list('longer' = resultsDF, 'shorter' = resultsDF[1:10000,]), gdb = sparrow::getMSigGeneSetDb(collection = 'h', species = 'human', id.type = 'entrez'))
ct.gatherSparrow(sparrowres)
