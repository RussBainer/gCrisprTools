Description: Set of tools for evaluating pooled high-throughput screening experiments, 
    typically employing CRISPR/Cas9 or shRNA expression cassettes. Contains methods for interrogating 
    library and cassette behavior within an experiment, identifying differentially abundant
    cassettes, aggregating signals to identify candidate targets for empirical validation, 
    hypothesis testing, and comprehensive reporting.
