Description: Set of tools for evaluating pooled high-throughput screening experiments,
    typically employing CRISPR/Cas9 or shRNA expression cassettes. Contains methods for interrogating
    library and cassette behavior within an experiment, identifying differentially abundant
    cassettes, aggregating signals to identify candidate targets for empirical validation,
    hypothesis testing, and comprehensive reporting. Version 2.0 extends these applications to include 
    a variety of tools for contextualizing and integrating signals across many experiments, incorporates 
    extended signal enrichment methodologies via the "sparrow" package, and 
    streamlines many formal requirements to aid in interpretablity.
