\title{Generate a QC report from a pooled CRISPR screen}
\usage{
ct.makeQCReport(eset, trim, log2.ratio, sampleKey, annotation, aln, identifier,
  lib.size, geneSymb = NULL, outdir = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{eset}{An ExpressionSet object containing, at minimum, a matrix of gRNA
abundances extractable with the \code{exprs()} function and some named 
phenodata extractable with \code{pData()}.}

\item{trim}{The number of gRNAs to be trimmed from the top of the 
distribution before estimating the abundance range. Empirically, this 
usually should be equal to about 2 to 5 percent of the guides in the 
library.}

\item{log2.ratio}{Maximum abundance of contaminant gRNAs, expressed on the
log2 scale from the top of the trimmed range of each sample. That is,
\code{log2.ratio = 4} means to discard all gRNAs whose abundance is
(1/2)^4 of the trimmed maximum.}

\item{sampleKey}{A sample key, supplied as an ordered factor linking the 
samples to experimental variables. The \code{names} attribute should 
exactly match those present in \code{eset}, and the control set is assumed
to be the first \code{level}.}

\item{annotation}{An annotation object for the experiment. See the man page 
for \code{ct.prepareAnnotation} for details and example format.}

\item{aln}{A numeric alignment matrix, where rows correspond to "targets", 
"nomatch", "rejections", and "double_match", and where columns correspond 
to experimentasl samples.}

\item{identifier}{A character string to name the report and corresponding 
subdirectories. If provided, the final report will be called 
'\code{identifier}.html' and will be located in a directory called 
\code{identifier}. If \code{NULL}, a generic name including the timestamp 
will be generated.}

\item{lib.size}{Optional numeric vector of limma-type size factors}

\item{geneSymb}{The \code{geneSymbol} identifier(s) in \code{annotation} 
that corresponds to gRNAs to be plotted on the curves. Passed through to 
\code{\link{ct.gRNARankByReplicate}}, \code{\link{ct.viewControls}} and 
\code{\link{ct.prepareAnnotation}} (as \code{controls} argument if it's
not \code{NULL}). Default \code{NULL}.}

\item{outdir}{An optional character string indicating the directory in which
to generate the report. If \code{NULL}, a temporary directory will be
automatically generated.}
}
\value{
The path to the generated html report.
}
\description{
This is a function to generate an html QC report for a CRISPR 
  screen, focusing on experiment-level and library-level analyses collected 
  from other functions in \code{gCrisprTools}. It is designed to be used 
  'as-is', and analysts interested in using different functionalities of the
  various functions should do that outside of this wrapper script.
