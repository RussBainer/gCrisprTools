\title{View a stacked representation of the most variable targets or individual guides within an experiment,
as a percentage of the total aligned reads}
\usage{
ct.stackGuides(eset, sample.ordering = "SAMPLE_LABEL", nguides = 20,
  plotType = "gRNA", annotation = NULL, ylimit = NULL, fit = NULL,
  contrast.term = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{eset}{An ExpressionSet  object containing, at minimum, a matrix of gRNA abundances extractable with the exprs() function, and a metadata
object containing a column named \code{SAMPLE_LABEL} containing unique identifers for each sample.}

\item{sample.ordering}{An optional string corresponding to the column in the \code{eset} metadata to use when arranging the samples for visualization.}

\item{nguides}{The number of guides (or targets) to display.}

\item{plotType}{A string indicating whether the individual guides should be displayed ("\code{gRNA}"), or if they should be aggregated into target-level
estimates ("\code{Target}") according to the \code{geneSymbol} column in the \code{annotation} object.}

\item{annotation}{An optional data.frame containing an annotation object to be used to aggregate the guides into targets, usually extracted with}

\item{ylimit}{An optional numeric vector of length 2 specifying the y limits for the plot, useful in comparin across studies.
\code{ep.load.annot()} in ExpressionPlot. gRNAs are annotated by row, and must minimally contain a column \code{geneSymbol} indicating the target elements.}

\item{fit}{An object of class \code{MArrayLM} containing, at minimum, a \code{coefficents} slot with coefficients from the comparison,
and a \code{contrasts} slot indicating the relevant comparisons.}

\item{contrast.term}{A parameter passed to \code{ct.preprocessFit} in the event that the fit object contains data from multiple contrasts. See
that man page for further details.}
}
\value{
A stacked barplot displaying the appropriate entities on the default device.

\description{
This function identifies the gRNAs or targets that change the most from sample to sample within an experiment as a percentage of
the entire library. It then plots the abundance of the top \code{nguides} as a stacked barplot for all samples in the experiment. The purpose of this
algorithm is to detect potential distortions in the library composition that might not be properly controlled by sample normalization, and so
the most variable entites are defined by calculating the percent of aligned reads that they contribute to each sample, and then ranking each entity
by the range of these percentages across all samples. Consequently, gRNAs or Targets that are highly abundant in at least one condition will be
are more likely to be identified.
